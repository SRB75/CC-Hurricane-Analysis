# CC-Hurricane-Analysis
Jupyter Notebook showing my solutions to questions related to sample Category 5 Atlantic Hurricane Data.  The data covers the years from 1928 to 2018.

**Where is this from?**
The questions come from a Project hosted on CodeCademy's website.  The Project is part of the Python training in both the Data Science, and Python curricula. 

**Type of file?**
This is a Jupyter Notebook file where the questions and sample data were predefined. 

**Whose work is included?**
All answers are my own.  I consulted multiple sources of help during the process (including AI), but ultimately went with the solution that was most intuitive to me.
